This Package directory is a place holder for packages required for the analysis. Contains empty files for the program executables to show as an example. 
You can also see specific versions of packages which we have already tested for compatibility. 
Feel free to install the packages or point to your already existing packages according to your analysis. Also, make sure to change file paths/names in the configuration files accordingly.
