#Workflow details:

This is an example for ChIP-Seq peakcalling workflow:
    Fastq, fastq screen ->  alignment to hg19 with BWA -> filter low map quality reads -> coordinate sort -> peak calls using MACS2  
Note:
You can switch the packages versions as long they dont break the workflow.
Please make sure the required packages are installed and sourced in your environment PATH.

#How to run:
cd <your_working directory>
yap --check workflow_configuration.cfg

The "yap --check"  command checks to see

* If all paths specified are valid
* If YAP finds the appropriate input files
* Checks for syntax errors
* Lists commands to be executed.
* Gives section-wise error/warning report.

#The next step is to run the YAP job:

mpirun -n <number_of_cores> yap workflow_configuration.cfg

If you have a SGE environment. Pass the number of slots variable $NSLOTS.
