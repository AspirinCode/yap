#Workflow Details:

These configurations are set up for a demo GATK variant calling workflow. This consists of BWA alignment, regrouping of the mutiple lane data and postprocess using GATK

User can  modify the the postprocess configuration file for using a different version of GATK.


#How to run:
cd <your_working directory>
yap --check workflow_configuration.cfg

The "yap --check"  command checks to see

* If all paths specified are valid
* If YAP finds the appropriate input files
* Checks for syntax errors
* Lists commands to be executed.
* Gives section-wise error/warning report.

#The next step is to run the YAP job:

mpirun -n <number_of_cores> yap workflow_configuration.cfg

If you have a SGE environment. Pass the number of slots variable $NSLOTS.
