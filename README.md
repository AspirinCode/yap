YAP
===
YAP is an extensible parallel framework, written in python using openmpi libraries. It allows researchers to quickly build high throughput big data pipelines without extensive knowledge of parallel programming. The user interacts with the framework through simple configuration files to capture analysis parameters and user directed metadata, enabling reproducible research. Using YAP, analysts have been able to achieve a significant speed up of upto 36x in RNASeq workflow execution times.
